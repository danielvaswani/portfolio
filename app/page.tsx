            I am a Fullstack Typescript developer with more emphasis on
            Frontend. I have studied at Fontys for several years, conducting
            successful projects with clients and interned at TopicalMeetings and
            Jumbo. In my free time I love to make side projects showcasing my
            skills in JS/TS technologies like React/Vue on the Frontend, and a
            simple serverless backend by either utilizing metaframeworks like
            NextJS, Nuxt, or even using expressjs, with both SQL and NoSQL DBs.
